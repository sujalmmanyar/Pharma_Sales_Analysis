# Pharma_Sales_Analysis
Cleaned a messy pharmaceutical dataset using Python by handling missing values, standardizing inconsistent product names, stockist names, and month formats.
Automated tasks like value replacement and date formatting that would be tedious and error-prone in Excel.
Resulted in a clean, uniform, and reusable dataset ready for analysis, saving time and improving accuracy over manual methods.
